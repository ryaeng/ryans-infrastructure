# Ryan's Infrastructure #

I'm Ryan England and this is my infrastructure. I work at Akamai Compute and a few of my hobbies, 
include shooting a basketball, lifting, reading books and...  SELF-HOSTING projects.

I'll be using this repo to store my infrastructure as code (IaC). My blog will also point here to
reference code that supports the correlating post.
